<h1>Why View This Site On A Computer</h1>
<br><br><br><br>
<div><p style="font-size: 1.5em;">Most of the content on this site is coded to be used on a computer/laptop. Using a mobile device limits the width of the site and therefore, our site is adjusted for mobile usage. Our user interface is much better on PC/laptop since it is a wider display. Our priority is consumer convenience so we wanted to let you know why viewing our website on PC/laptop is encouraged. Thank you for using Scientail!
